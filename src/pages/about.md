### Iâ€™m a dad, husband, software developer, and friend to most.

I've spent much of my life on a computer, despite not growing up in a technical environment. I am the son of two immigrants from Argentina, raised in tropical Miami, Florida.

As technology became more pervasive in everyday life, so did my interest in its inner workings. I grew fascinated by the limitless information both available and targeted to everyone, and how to better make sense of it all.

I love talking about tech; in learning from others as well as helping the less savvy. Wanna chat? Feel free to [contact](/contact) me.

### Colophon

This website is a reflection of my many learnings over the years and a work toward publicizing my own personal knowledge base. Mostly written in Markdown and built with Astro, a static site generator. Deployed and hosted on Netlify, a web developer platform that I've come to love over the past two years. Set in your browser's favorite sans serif system font. No cookies or trackers being used.
