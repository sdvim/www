### I’m a software developer, husband, dad of three cats, and friend to most.

With relentless confidence, internet access, and a bit of luck, I managed to turn a childhood hobby into a successful career. Grateful for my journey, I'd like to commit to helping fellow underrepresented people in tech. Particularly those who are Black, Latinx, and/or other first-gen Americans— the very fabric of people who nurtured me with love and friendship and got me to where I am today.
