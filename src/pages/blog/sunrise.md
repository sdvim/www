In my excitement for my in-laws to arrive yesterday I got up unusually early and managed to see the sunrise for the first time in years. Not just any sunrise, but one eclipsed by mountains.

Then some realizations struck me.

**First.** I moved to Utah in 2020 and this was the first time seeing the sun shine behind the mountains. I instinctually felt shame for having missed out for so long, but then quickly forgave myself considering the struggle I endured until very recently.

**Second.** This is view is basically in my backyard. Every. Single. Day. I just have to show up! I even have Celeste and Luciano to share it with. Though if they understandably want more sleep, I can always count on my cat Lorenzo who adores going outside.

**Third.** My very first date with Celeste capped off with watching the sunrise on a beach in Miami, almost four years ago. To think of the several major life events and growth I've experienced in a seemingly short time made realize how far I've come. How I'm exactly where I need to be right now.

I have a deep admiration for mountains as someone from the flat swampy lands of Florida. I'm all the more grateful for everything I have in my life, especially the everyday moments like this one.
